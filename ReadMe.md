# Artificial Intelligence - Computer Assignment #2 - Fall 2021
## University of Tehran
### Minimax & Genetic Algorithms

In this hands-on, we will implement and solve two problems with min-max and genetic algorithms.

* Checkers game:
  * In this question, we will get acquainted with the min-max algorithm used in many games and develop ideas to evaluate and solve checkers. (`pygame` library is used.)

* Sudoku:
  * In this question, we get acquainted with the methods that are derived from nature and natural selection. In these methods, which are generally called genetic algorithms, we use ideas for modeling mating, mutation and natural selection.
  * Genetic algorithms generally apply to problems with large state space; These algorithms do this by sampling the population and combining, changing, and evaluating them, and try to improve the answers from generation to generation to achieve the desired answer.
